# Stock-Analysis

***Overview of Project

**Refactor your code to loop through the data only once and collect all of the information it needs in a single pass. Refactoring is the process of reorganizing code without changing what it accomplishes. Code can be refactored to be faster, use less memory, or just to be easier to read.


***Purpose of Analysis
**To refactor the code to loop through the data and collect all of the information in a single move. 
**I was able to get results for 2017 but for some reason couldn’t reach the results for 2018. Couldn’t find the explanation for it. It seems though that 2017 was able to get a positive return in their stocks. 

***Advantages of refactoring code
**Design of software, makes software easier to understand, helps us find bugs and also helps in executing the program faster. 

***Disadvantage of refactoring code

**Time consuming to do the code. Also, somewhat confusing, lost track of where I was in the process and had to just eventually turn in what I had done.

***Summary of Results
**Well it seems that refactoring gives out more organized data, but it seems in my case it took longer to process the data into the spreadsheet. Probably should of just used the template that module provided to help for me to stay organized and solve the module.
